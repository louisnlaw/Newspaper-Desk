        <h3>This wallpaper is designed for Mac OS.</h3>

<p>I'm an intensive daily news reader that I keep myself updated by using RSS reader apps. Later I found it more convenient if I had the news exhibited on desktop and renewed automatically. The function is easily executed by Geektool from <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">Tynsoe.Org</a>, which is able to display useful system info on desktop background. Or even integrate them as part of our wallpapers. Now this awesome tool is available in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/geektool/id456877552?mt=12">Mac App Store</a> where you can directly get a copy for free.</p>

<p>On the desktop, every piece of constantly changing information is generated by Geektool. Each refreshing rate is based on your setting individually. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/geeklets/about/">Geeklets</a> website founder <a href="http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/geeklets/about/">Matt Swain</a>, abundant scripts have been published and shared over the world. And this is where I started learning the toolkit.</p>

<h5>Current Weather from Yahoo! Weather</h5>

<p>We need 3 shell scripts to display current weather report as well as an icon for a certain city.</p>
<h6>City Main Page</h6>
<pre><code>curl --silent "http://weather.yahoo.com/xxx/xxx/xxx-xxx/?unit=c" | grep "forecast-icon" | sed "s/.*background\:url(\'\(.*\)\')\;\ _background.*/\1/" | xargs curl --silent -o /tmp/weather.png\</code></pre>
<p>Open <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Weather</a>, search for the city you want, copy the page URL and replace the script's counterpart.</p>
<h6>City RSS</h6>
<pre><code>curl --silent "http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=CHXX0116&u=c" | grep -E '(Current Conditions:|C<BR)' | sed -e 's/Current Conditions://' -e 's/<br \/>//' -e 's/<b>//' -e 's/<\/b>//' -e 's/<BR \/>//' -e 's/<description>//' -e 's/<\/description>//'</code></pre>
<p>On the city page you just landed, copy its RSS link at the upper right corner and replace the script's counterpart as well.</p>
<h6>Weather Icon</h6>
<pre><code>file:///tmp/weather.png</code></pre>
<p>You don't need to do anything regarding this code UNLESS you want more than one cities being displayed in the same time. To make it more clear, if you show reports for two cities, one of their icon file "weather.png" has to be renamed differently as you prefer but must be consistent for both the script of City Main Page and the Weather Icon. Otherwise both cities will exhibit the same weather icon.</p>
